# Kanopi Code Test for WordPress Developers
Welcome! Thank you so much for your interest in Kanopi Studios. This project is designed to showcase your plugin design approach and your knowledge of a few core features of WordPress.

## The rules
1. Please spend no more than **three hours** on this project. It's okay if you do not finish in that time; just make sure you provide a clear outline of what you have done, what is still to do, and any known issues.
2. Please do your work in a **fork** of this repository.
3. The timestamp of your last commit will be the cutoff time used. Any commits after the three-hour mark will not be considered as part of your submission.
4. Please use WordPress coding and documentation standards as defined in PHPCS.
5. All files must be managed in a plugin.
6. Your solution may not rely on a third-party plugin.
7. Your work will be tested on a default WordPress installation running Twentynineteen and using the standard Theme Unit Test content.

## The task
1. Get the quote of the day using the public API from [They Said So](https://theysaidso.com/api/).
3. Output the quote of the day at the bottom of all posts. Use semantic markup.
4. Display the meta information like tags, links, etc, in a semantically appropriate way.
5. Use a standalone CSS file that is injected into the theme to format your output. Create a polished final product that works harmoniously with any standard theme.
6. Ensure your solution meets the attribution and usage requirements for public consumption of this API.

## Ideas for extra fun stuff :tada:
